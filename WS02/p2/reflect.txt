1. The most difficult expression I had to code in this workshop is that there should be a 'space' before '%c'. For example, the code is: scanf(" %c", &Type_1); I had checked many times to find out the problem for nearly two hours. Finally, I learned that there is a flush area to store some temporary data. When we input a character in the terminal, we will input "Enter" to jump to the next line and input the second character. However, the flush area will record "Enter" as the next charater, so it will not execute the next 'scanf()' and jump to the next code, so it is necessary to put a 'space' before '%c' or use getchar() to take out "Enter" from the flush area. But if we input an 'int' or some data not belonging to 'char', it will not recongize "Enter", and it will keep going.

2. logical expressions code: Strength == 'm' && Type == 'l'; In "deMorgan's Law", it should be: !(Strength == 'r' || Type == 'b'); In another way, the code can be expressed that: Strength !== 'r' && Type !== 'b'.

3. We did not use a variable to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit because we need to input a value to determine Celsius for the three different coffee types. Therefore, we also need three different variables to convert to Fahrenheit because we need to output three different values in the table. Thus, it would not be convient to create three new varibles. We can put the formula in the code and copy it for the next line/type.
