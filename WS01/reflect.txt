In this workshop, I learned how to display some sentences using c programing, and knew some types of C. In my feeling, it is really hard to debug, and it may spend many hours to find a really small error.
SSH is a kind of safe protocal for remote login. I used SSH to log in the Seneca Server.
SFTP is a way to transfer the data under SSH. I used SFTP to open a folder and submit the assignment to my matrix account in the Seneca Server.
