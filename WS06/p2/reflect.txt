1. In the workshop, I used itemCost[], itemPriority[], and financeOptions[] to store item's cost, priority and finance options respectively. In the program, I prompt the user to input some personal information of each item, and I scanned the information into different parallel arrays. The most important thing is making the elements of the same item at the same index to accomplish holding data related to the same entity. For example, the first item's cost should be stored in itemCost[0], and its priority should be stored in itemPriority[0].

2.  The iterator variable usually initializes to zero because the first index of the first element is 0 in the array in the C language. Thus, initializing the iterator variable is convenient to correspond to the same element in the array. For example, in my program, I initialized i = 0 and made i++ of the change until i < itemNum. I can store what the user input into different arrays with index of i, such as itemCost[i], itemPriority[i], and financeOptions[i]. However, if I initialized i = 1, I should change the index to i - 1, such as itemCost[i-1].

3. An array is a way we put something in a table with rows and columns. For example, when we go to the supermarket, we can buy many things, such as candies, cookies, toys, eggs, and apples. We put all these things into a bag, and this bag can be regarded as an array. If we line the things up left to right, the line is a row in an array. And these things have different prices, different colours and different shapes. These different characters belong to a thing. For example, the apple is 3 dollars, red, and circle. The different characters are columns in an array, which is the vertical line from top to bottom to describe the apple. So we can make a table to record the different things in an array with different characters, such as egg is yellow and apple is red. These different things, such as cookies, eggs, and apples, are called elements in an array.
